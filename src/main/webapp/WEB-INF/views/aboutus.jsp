							<p>
								Has <strong>logistics been an impediment</strong> more than an
								enabler for your business? Have you found yourself at the <strong>receiving
									end of price fluctuations</strong> from transporters without being
								guaranteed proper service? And even after giving the load, do
								you face major <strong>fluctuations in delivery times</strong>
								and quality of service?
							</p>
							<p>We at CargoBolt are solving these problems by building
								a one-stop hassle free solution for all your trucking needs.
								Gone are the days when you would lose sleep over the location of
								your cargo shipments. Whether you have a one-off requirement for
								trucks for cargo movement or are looking for a long-term
								strategic partner, we would be happy to help. Through technology
								and our fleet of partner truck owners and drivers, we wish to
								bring the same level of efficiency in cargo movement that
								you expect for your own travel in flights.</p>
